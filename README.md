# sentiment_stocks
Exploration of sentiment and stock data


## Purpose 
The purpose of this exploration is to look at trends in both how we comment and what we know. In this analysis, I will look at how the financial markets can be swayed with more in-depth metrics than just "frequency of comments". The analysis will look at:
- Twitter feed data
    - Comments for a subject matter related to a business
    - e.g. EV's and Tesla stock
- Google Trends Data
- News api's
    - To find recent articles highlighting the strength of a stock


## Technology Used
To make this project work, we'll have to open our toolchest to the following:
- Python
    - Pandas for data manipulation
    - Requests for API usage
    - Matplotlib for visual analysis
    - Tweepy for Twitter data

- Jupyter notebook
